# pacmen
Pacman exercise, with images simulating multiple pacmen moving and chomping, with margins as limits
Note there are 4 png images, which in turn produce movement
There is an HTML index file, which places structure on the aformentioned project, and has the button placeholder
And finally there is a javascript file, where everything is codified
